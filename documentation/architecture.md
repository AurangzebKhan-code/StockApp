# React Native Stock Application - Architecture Documentation

## Architecture Overview

This React Native Stock Application is built with a focus on maintainability, performance, and clean code. The architecture follows these key principles:

### Component Hierarchy

- **Screens**: Top-level components representing full screens in the app.
- **Components**: Reusable UI building blocks.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks encapsulating business logic and state management.
- **Services**: API interactions and data manipulation.

### State Management

- Local component state for UI-specific state.
- Custom hooks for shared logic and data fetching.
- Prop passing for component communication.

### Navigation

- React Navigation for screen transitions.
- Stack-based navigation for simple and intuitive flow.

## Design Patterns and Practices Applied

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - Each component has a single responsibility (e.g., StockCard for rendering a single stock's preview, StockList for managing the list).
   - Services are separated from UI components (stockService.ts).

2. **Open/Closed Principle**:
   - Components are designed to be extensible without modification (e.g., StockCard can be extended with new props without changing its core functionality).

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**:
   - Type definitions ensure substitutability (Stock interface).

4. **Interface Segregation**:
   - Props interfaces are specific to each component's needs (SearchBarProps, StockCardProps).

5. **Dependency Inversion**:
   - High-level components depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

### Higher-Order Components (HOC)

The `withErrorHandling` HOC demonstrates how to enhance components with additional functionality:
- It wraps components with error boundary protection.
- It follows the composition pattern to extend component functionality.

### Pure Components

- Components like `StockCard`, `SearchBar`, and `SortOptions` are wrapped with `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.

### Custom Hooks

- `useDebounce`: Optimizes performance by preventing excessive operations during rapid input changes.
- `useFetchStocks`: Encapsulates the data fetching logic, separating it from the UI components.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Reusable components avoid code duplication.
- Utility functions like `formatCurrency` centralize common operations.

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling with `ErrorBoundary` component.
- Try/catch blocks in async operations with appropriate user feedback.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Debouncing**:
   - Search input is debounced to prevent excessive API calls.

2. **Memoization**:
   - React.memo for pure components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - useCallback for event handlers to maintain referential equality.

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Images load on demand as users scroll through the list.

### Type Safety

- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout the application.
- Props validation through TypeScript interfaces.

## Testing Strategy

The application includes two types of tests:

1. **Component Tests**:
   - Tests for rendering and interaction with individual components.
   - Ensures components display the correct information and respond to user interactions.

2. **Functional Tests**:
   - Tests for user flows and behavior.
